# About uMigrate
uMigrate is a social web application for university students to use while completing their undergraduate or graduate degree. It is designed to assist students with the non-academic side of university life through a variety of features.

# Features
The uMigrate website and mobile app come with a variety of features to make the most of your university experience.

## Community
Share posts, events, survey polls, and more with other university students in your region. Whether you're on your study or work term, uMigrate will help you make new connections with other students to talk about common interest, share experiences, participate in events together, and more! Communities also come with a group messaging chat so you can have exciting conversations with others.

## Used Items Market Place
Are you leaving campus to start your work term but don't need all those unopened packs of paper? Feel free to advertise your used products with uMigrate so others can buy it from you! Whether you want to buy or sell textbooks, iClickers, a microwave, etc., uMigrate will help you find people to buy your used items or sell theirs to you! uMigrate also has a search toolbar for you to look for exactly what you want to buy.

## Housing
Switching between study and work terms can take a toll on you, and finding housing every 4 - 8 months can be a burden. Luckily, uMigrate can help you find housing leases, subleases, etc. being sold by other university students. Search for housing options that fit your needs in the regions you want, and connect with the seller through uMigrate's messaging platform.

## Messaging
uMigrate comes with a built-in messaging platform for students to communicate with each other. Use reactions, emojis, quotes, you name it. Messaging is also integrated into other features such as the Used Items Market Place and Housing pages. You see a textbook for sale in the Used Items Market Place but want to contact the seller for more information? With uMigrate, it's as simple as clicking "Contact" next to the housing post and it will take you straight to the seller's direct messages.

## Profile
Share information you want people to know about you through your profile. Are you looking to talk to someone who worked at a company you want to apply for? You can check other students profiles for previous occupations they've had and see some information as to what they did. This can help you start some interesting conversations with people who share your interests. All profiles are verified through their university emails, so you can be assured that everyone is transparent with their identities.
